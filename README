dautostart is a simple standalone script that autostarts applications according to the
freedesktop autostart spec ( http://standards.freedesktop.org/autostart-spec/autostart-spec-latest.html )

It's intended for end-users building their own environment (although
everyone - including DE projects - is free to use this)

It's written in sh.  It only depends on sh. nothing else.

Currently dautostart is in a very early phase of development and not ready
for production use.
