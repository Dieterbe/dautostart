dautostart is a simple standalone script that autostarts applications according to the
freedesktop autostart spec ( http://standards.freedesktop.org/autostart-spec/autostart-spec-latest.html )
It's intended for end-users building their own environment (although everyone - including DE developers - can use this)


Dependencies: sh. nothing else.
Licensce:     GPL3. See COPYING.

Notes:
 * Check the TODO file for things that are not finished yet.
 * If you want to use the OnlyShowIn and NotShowIn directives in .desktop files, export the DESKTOP_ENVIRONMENT variable so dautostart can know which
   DE it's in.  (otherwise those variables will be ignored)
 * Bureports can be made at: http://dieter.plaetinck.be/dautostart_a_standalone_freedesktop-compliant_application_starter
